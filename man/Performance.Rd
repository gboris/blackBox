\usage{
Performance(object, metric = "AUROC", consensus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{the blkboxCV or blkbox output}

\item{metric}{Which metric will be used for performance. Area under the Receiver operating curve = "AUROC", Accuracy = "ACC", Error rate = "ERR", Matthews correlation coefficient = "MCC", F-1 score = "F-1", Sensitivity or True Positive Rate = "TPR", Specificity or True Negative Rate = "TNR". default = "AUROC".}

\item{consensus}{if the process was repeated it will calculate the consensus vote for each sample across the repititons before then calculating the performance across all samples. Default is False.}
}
\description{
Determines the performance of each model within the blkbox or blkboxCV output. Can choose from a range of performance metrics.
