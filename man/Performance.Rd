\usage{
Performance(object, metric, consensus)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{the blkboxCV or blkbox output}

\item{metric}{Which metric will be used for performance. Area under the Receiver operating curve = "AUROC", Accuracy = "ACC", Error rate = "ERR", Matthews correlation coefficient = "MCC", F-1 score = "F-1". default = "AUROC".}

\item{consensus}{if the process was repeated it will calculate the consensus vote for each sample across the repititons before then calculating the performance across all samples. Default is False.}
}
\description{
