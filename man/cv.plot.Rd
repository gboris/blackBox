\title{Crossfold Validation Performance Plot}
\usage{
cv.plot(obj, metric, y_ranges, title, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object produced by the BlackBocCV function.}

\item{metric}{Which metric you wish to plot. Area under the Receiver operating curve = "AUROC", Accuracy = "ACC", Error rate = "ERR", Matthews correlation coeffecient = "MCC", F-1 score = "F-1".}

\item{y_ranges}{is the y axis limits for the plot, defaults to c(0,1). Must be a numeric vector with two entries. Invalid for barplots.}

\item{title}{the title to be adhered to the plot. Default is no title.}

\item{type}{The plot can be either a barplot or boxplot. For the barplot the consensus performance is used, for a boxplot consensus is false. If only one performance measure is found for each algorithm then it will be forced to a barplot.}
}
\description{
Compares the performance of each algorithm in a boxplot OR barplot. Each holdout will contribute at least one data point to each algorithm.
